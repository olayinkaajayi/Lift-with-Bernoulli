# Modelling Lift of an Airfoil Using Bernoulli Principle
The Bernoulli equation can be used to create a simple model of lift generation of an airfoil as a function of the airfoil’s geometry, the pressure, density, and velocity of fluid around the airfoil, and other parameters such as elevation.

This is a simple C program that is run on the Signaloid Cloud Developer Platform, which incorporates uncertainty in some of the model parameters.

## The Model, Parameters and Underlying Assumptions

For our design, we include the following parameters: `air velocity` ($v$), `air density` ($\rho$) and `airfoil area` ($A$). The lift force ($L$) generated by an airfoil is given by the expression

$\qquad$ $L = \Delta P \cdot A$

where $\Delta P$ is the pressure difference above and below the airfoil. The model is designed, with the following assumptions:

* We model the pressure difference using the Bernoulli's equation, given as:

$\qquad$ $P + \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 + \rho gh = \text{constant}$.

* We assume that the height ($h$) is constant for our model, therefore

$\qquad$ $\Delta P = \frac{1}{2}\rho(v_2^2 - v_1^2)$,


$\qquad$ $v_1$ and $v_2$ is the velocity below and above the airfoil respectively.

* We assume standard atmospheric conditions for temperature and pressure, and the `air density` is measured using the device described in [^0], which has a tolerance of $8.5\%$.

* We assume that the `area` of the airfoil designed by a manufacturer is $15\mathrm{m}^2$, and with an acceptable error margin of $0.01\mathrm{m}^2$.

* We assume that the measured `velocity` above the airfoil $v_2$ follows a normal distribution with a mean of $10\mathrm{ms}^{-1}$ and variance of $0.5\mathrm{ms}^{-1}$, and the measurements for $v_1$ is also normally distributed with mean of $6\mathrm{ms}^{-1}$ and variance of $0.3\mathrm{ms}^{-1}$.

## Program Commandline Arguments

The C program can take in the following commandline arguments:

`-v`: velocity above airfoil

`-s`: variance of $v_2$

`-u`: velocity below airfoil

`-r`: variance of $v_1$

`-A`: area of airfoil

`-t`: tolerance for airfoil area

In the absence of any commandline argument, the default values are used.
